This project uses an Arduino to control LEDs based on scheduled times using a DS1302 RTC (Real-Time Clock) module and a LiquidCrystal I2C LCD. The system supports configuration through buttons and serial input. The objective is to design and implement a digital drug dispenser system that tracks and displays the current time, allows the users to set and adjust the cureent though push buttons and serial monitor, allows the user to shedule multiple medication timings 4 timingd for 4 drug containers through push buttons and serial monitor and alerts the user with a buzzer and led when it's time for medication.
